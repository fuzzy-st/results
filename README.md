# 🏗️ Result Pattern - Presently in Development 🏗️

A *highly* optimized, fully **type-safe**, *dependency free* utility for representing operations that can *either* **succeed** or **fail**.
Complete with:
- Comprehensive functional transformations
- Advanced error handling capabilities
- Async/Promise integration
- Performance optimizations
- Elegant composition patterns

Its a clean approach where by having **explicit error handling** we can craft *more reliable code* that doesn't rely on `try/catch` and exceptions for control flow.

## 🔍 Overview

This library aims to provide an elegant solution for handling operations that can succeed or fail in TypeScript applications. It addresses the common problems with traditional exception-based error handling while maintaining full type safety and composability.

Unlike traditional error handling with exceptions, this library seeks to enable us with the following:

- **Explicit error handling** with proper type information
- **Composable operations** that might fail
- **Functional transformations** of success and error values
- **Predictable control flow** without hidden exceptional paths
- **Better testability** through deterministic error handling
- **Performance optimizations** for high-throughput scenarios
